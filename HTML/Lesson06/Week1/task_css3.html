	<h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

	<h2>Linear Equations</h2>

	<p class="text">
	A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
	</p>
	<p class="formula">
		<span class="formula">ax + b = 0</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	where <span class="highlight">a</span> and 
	<span class="highlight">b</span> are real numbers and 
	<span class="highlight">x</span> is a variable. This form is 
	sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. 
	Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
	Also, the variable may or may not be an 
	<span class="highlight">x</span> so don’t get too locked 
	into always seeing an 
	<span class="highlight">x</span> there.
	</p>

	<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

	The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

	ax^2 + bx + c = 0  

	where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.

	<h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

	[sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:

	A = [sign] [sign] r^2  

	or, when you know the diameter (D):
	A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2  

	or, when you know the circumference (C):
	A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign] 

	<h2>Intersection</h2>

	The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,

	A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }  

	That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
