    <h1>Vehicle</h1>

	<p class="text">
	A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum
	<a href="#end1" name="begin1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
	) is a machine that transports 
	people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles
	(motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), 
	watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled 
	vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and 
	spacecraft.
	<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
	</p>
	<p class="text">
	Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply 
	steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, 
	railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally
	used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and 
	definitions.
